About:

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic that happened during the year 2020, a lot of game centers lost revenue with claw games as their main source. What they did to remedy this issue is to create an online platform where users can play their favorite claw machine games from the safety of their own home. Our project is a similar creation of this idea brought about through the crisis that happened.
